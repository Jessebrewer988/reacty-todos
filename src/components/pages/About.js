        <p>This is a React todo list app. There are many like it but this one is mine. I'm happy to have you here. I will be adding more to this as time goes on because this is a good sandbox for basic React stuff. I'm planning on adding Authentication with Passport or 0Auth, a more fun API, and a backend database with MongoDB.</p>
        <p>Stay tuned.</p>
